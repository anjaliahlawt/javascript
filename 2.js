//ECMAScript: Think of it as the blueprint or plan for how JavaScript should be made.

//javascript:JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It's what makes things happen on a webpage, like animations, buttons that you can click, forms you can fill out, and much more.JavaScript was developed in 1995. It was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was developed in just 10 days and was originally called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," before finally being named "JavaScript.


// nodejs:Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. This means you can use JavaScript to build things like web servers, command-line tools, and other applications on your computer or server.

// JavaScript on the Server: Traditionally, JavaScript was used only in web browsers to make web pages interactive. Node.js changed that by allowing developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, meaning you can now use the same language (JavaScript) for both the front-end (what the user sees) and the back-end (the server that powers the website).

//Built on V8: Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. V8 is the part of Chrome that runs JavaScript code, and Node.js uses it to run JavaScript code on the server.
